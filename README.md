>The story of a romance between a man who is annoyed with relationships but likes to flirt and a woman who wants to date but does not believe in love.
>It portrays a realistic romance
>>Nevertheless tries to be different. It still shows the sweet, heart-fluttering moments that romance dramas are known for, but also depicts a realistic side to what modern dating looks like
